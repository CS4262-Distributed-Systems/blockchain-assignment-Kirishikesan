# Blockchain Concepts

1. **Issues in Blockchain based systems**
    - Timing & Ordering : Rectified by having an ordering service which will allow the peers to focus on validating transactions and committing them to the ledger
    - Consensus : Rectified by having a leader through leader election or assume that the first one who validated the transaction is correct

2. **Ledger & Smart Contract**

    - A ledger holds the facts about the current and historical state of the objects.
    - A smart contract is an executable logic that can generate new facts and add them to the ledger.
